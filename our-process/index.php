We begin your home buying process by meeting with you to review our standard floorplans and features. We will also discuss the feasibility and cost estimates of any major personalizations you wish to make to your home at this time.

			<h4>Full Selections and Construction</h4>
			<p>
After we finalize the sales agreement, we work with you to complete all of the selections for your new home. Our typical build time for a new home is six months, and there will be several opportunities for you to see the progress of the home throughout its construction.

			<h4>Delivery and Service</h4>
			<p>
Upon completion of construction, you will tour the new home with us to verify that all work is properly completed. After settlement, your new home is covered by a warranty should any issues arise. About one year after settlement, we will do a final walk through with you to address any and all outstanding warrantable work.
